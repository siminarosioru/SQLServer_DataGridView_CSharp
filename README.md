# Description
I used my SQLServerDatabase project, the Table_Users.

The steps are:
   * open Visual Studio 2019 -> select WindowsFormsApp (.NET Framework)
   * open Server Explorer from C # -> connect to your DataBase
   * add DataGridView from Toolbox + SHOW RECORDS button + UPDATE RECORD button
   * need the connection string object to connect to the sequel server DataBase
   
When you want: 
   * to change something in your table -> click the "UPDATE RECORD" button -> click the "SHOW RECORDS" button 
   * to add a new record -> click the "UPDATE RECORD" button -> click the "SHOW RECORDS" button 
   * to delete the record -> click on the row -> click on the delete button, which is on your keyboard -> click "UPDATE RECORD" button -> click "SHOW RECORDS" button
